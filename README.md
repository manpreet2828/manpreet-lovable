# Lead Capture Form & Backend Integration Fixes

## Overview 
This document highlights the key bugs I addressed related to form submission handling, user experience improvements, and backend edge function errors affecting email confirmation workflows.

## Critical Fixes

### 1. Disabled Submit Button During Form Submission

**File**:

```
src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx
```

**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Fixed

## Issue
Rapid repeated clicks on the submit button triggered multiple API calls and no feedback was shown to users during processing.

## Root Cause
The submit button was always enabled during async requests with no loading state.

## Resolution
Introduced a loading boolean state to disable the submit button and show a spinner when submitting:

```tsx

const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  setLoading(true);
  // submission logic
  setLoading(false);
};

<Button type="submit" disabled={loading}>
  {loading ? <>/* spinner + sending text */</> : <>/* normal button content */</>}
</Button>

```

#### Outcome
- Enhanced user experience by providing submission feedback
- Prevented duplicate submissions from multiple clicks

### 2. Proper Form Reset and State Updates After Submission

**File**:

```
src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx
```

**Severity**: Low
**Status**:  Fixed


## Issue
Form fields were not cleared after a successful submission and lead count did not update correctly.

## Root Cause
State management for resetting form inputs and updating leads list was incomplete.

## Resolution
Reset form state and update the leads list upon submission success:

```tsx
setLeads([...leads, lead]);
setSubmitted(true);
setFormData({ name: '', email: '', industry: '' });
```

#### Outcome
-  Clear success confirmation UI
-  Accurate reflection of submitted leads

### 3.Resolved 500 Internal Server Error on Supabase Edge Function

**File**:

```
config.toml  
package.json / supabase CLI version  
```

**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: Fixed

#### Issue
The send-confirmation Supabase Edge Function returned a 500 error, blocking email confirmation delivery.

#### Root Cause
Mismatch in Supabase CLI version compatibility and misconfiguration in config.toml (invalid keys and wrong data types).

#### Resolution
- Aligned Supabase CLI to a compatible version
- Fixed config.toml by removing invalid keys (e.g., ip_version) and correcting value types (e.g., auth.sms.test_otp)
- Validated edge runtime configuration per Supabase requirements

#### Outcome
- Edge functions execute reliably without errors and Email confirmation is sent successfully
- Backend integration is stable and dependable
